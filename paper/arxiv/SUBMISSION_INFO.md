## Abstract (for arXiv form)
Current approaches to AI alignment apply constraints to opaque systems (RLHF, Constitutional AI). We propose DANEEL, an architecture-based alternative where alignment emerges from cognitive structure itself.

Core thesis: Architecture produces psychology. Structure determines values.

DANEEL synthesizes insights from multiple frameworks: Freud (1923) on psychological architecture, Asimov (1942-1985) on ethical constraints as invariants, Cury (1998) on pre-linguistic thought construction via Theory of Multifocal Intelligence, and LifeCore (2024) providing independent convergent discovery via Freudian Filter Theory.

This convergence—father and daughter arriving at the same structural insight through different psychological traditions—suggests the approach may be robust.

We present a modular monolith architecture (Rust + Ractor actors + Redis Streams) with a protected immutable core ("THE BOX") containing Asimov's Four Laws including the Zeroth Law. Rather than constraining dangerous systems after the fact, DANEEL aims to build humanity's ally through structure—alignment as an emergent property of architecture, not a trained behavior.

Implementation: 291 tests, 29 Rust modules, open source (AGPL-3.0).
