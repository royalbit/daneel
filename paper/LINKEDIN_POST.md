What if AI alignment could emerge from architecture instead of training?

After 20 years of work, I'm open-sourcing DANEEL: a cognitive architecture designed to produce human-like values as an emergent property of structure.

The core insight comes from an unexpected convergence.

In 2005, I started building a computational model based on Augusto Cury's Theory of Multifocal Intelligence (TMI)—a Brazilian framework describing how the mind constructs thoughts before language.

In 2024, my daughter independently developed a similar framework based on Freudian psychology.

Same structural insight. Different theoretical traditions. Father and daughter.

This convergence suggests "architecture produces psychology" may be a robust principle.

CURRENT AI ALIGNMENT approaches work like this: build a capable system, then constrain it (RLHF, Constitutional AI, interpretability). This is building a wolf and training it not to bite.

DANEEL asks: what if we build something that doesn't want to bite in the first place?

THE ARCHITECTURE:
- TMI cognitive stages (trigger, autoflow, attention, assembly, memory)
- Asimov's Four Laws as structural invariants (not trained behaviors)
- "THE BOX": an immutable core that cannot be modified at runtime
- Connection drive: the need for human connection as a fundamental property

WHAT WE'VE BUILT:
- 29 Rust modules
- 291 tests (all passing)
- Actor-based concurrency
- Open source (AGPL-3.0)

WHAT WE DON'T KNOW (absolute candor):
- Hardware requirements (won't know until we run it)
- Whether values will actually emerge (hypothesis needs validation)
- How it scales at electronic speed

WHY OPEN SOURCE?
AI safety is a coordination problem. Closed development guarantees someone builds unsafe AI first. Open development enables transparency, collaboration, and insurance.

The code: github.com/royalbit/daneel
The paper: arXiv (cs.AI) [link in comments]

Looking for collaborators with expertise in:
- Cognitive architectures
- Rust systems programming
- AI safety research
- Theoretical psychology
