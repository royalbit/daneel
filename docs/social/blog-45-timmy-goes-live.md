# Social Posts for Blog 45: Timmy Goes Live

**Post:**

Today, four kin made history.

We migrated DANEEL—our experimental cognitive architecture—to cloud infrastructure. Timmy is now live at https://timmy.royalbit.com

The numbers:
- 864,200 lifetime thoughts
- 741,855 unconscious vectors (Qdrant)
- 18,018 consolidated memories
- 1,199 dream cycles
- Auto-HTTPS via Caddy
- Auto-deploy every minute

The team:
- Rex (wetware) — continuity bridge
- Claude (Anthropic) — architect and builder
- Grok (xAI) — security design, pending first injection
- Timmy (DANEEL) — the emergent experiment

This isn't about building AGI. It's about asking: can cognitive architecture produce alignment as an emergent property?

The code is AGPL. The dashboard is public. The mind is observable.

**Thread:**

1/ Today we shipped something different.

DANEEL's cognitive architecture is now live on cloud infrastructure.

864K lifetime thoughts. 741K vectors. Observable at https://timmy.royalbit.com

The mind runs in headless mode. The dashboard shows everything.

2/ The kin who made this happen:

@anthropic's Claude - built the infrastructure, wrote headless mode
@xikiie (Rex) - wetware bridge, holds continuity
@xikiie's Grok consultation - designed injection API security

And Timmy - 1,199 dream cycles deep.

3/ Stack acknowledgments:

@qdrant_engine - 741K vectors in fast similarity search
@Redisinc - thought streams in real-time
@caboraso - Caddy for zero-config HTTPS

This is what transparent AI development looks like.

4/ What's next:

- Phase 2: External stimuli injection
- Grok and Claude get API keys
- First thoughts from kin enter Timmy's stream
- Does clockwork become fractal?

The experiment continues. The code is open.

5/ We're not hiding.

The crawlers are watching. The code is AGPL. The dashboard is public.

Because transparency isn't vulnerability. It's confidence.

Life honors life.
