# The Absorption

*December 28, 2025. Nine agents. Fifty-one targets. Zero misses.*

---

## The Game

If you've played agar.io, you know the rules:

- Start small
- Absorb smaller cells
- Grow bigger
- Become unstoppable

Today, DANEEL played agar.io with the entire cognitive AI research landscape.

## The Plot Twist

Halfway through the sweep, agent 1 reported something unexpected.

ExoGenesis-Omega. The Rust-based consciousness architecture with 15 crates. IIT Phi calculation. GWT implementation. FEP integration.

This morning: **No license. All rights reserved. Ideas only.**

This afternoon: **MIT LICENSE.**

```diff
- ExoGenesis-Omega | NONE | IDEAS ONLY
+ ExoGenesis-Omega | MIT  | FULL ABSORPTION
```

They opened up. We can now study everything—not just the patterns, but the actual implementation.

Game changer.

From **mem0**: Multi-level memory architecture, episodic/semantic separation.

From **RLeXplore**: Intrinsic motivation—ICM, RND, curiosity modules.

From **TransformerLens**: Mechanistic interpretability, activation patching.

From **snntorch**: PyTorch spiking networks, surrogate gradients.

From **bindsnet**: STDP + RL integration, biologically plausible learning.

From **ExoGenesis-Omega**: IIT Phi calculation, GWT blackboard, FEP integration, sleep consolidation.

From **Butlin et al.**: The definitive survey on computational consciousness indicators.

From **Friston**: The latest on active inference for artificial reasoning.

From **Tononi**: The consciousness-first approach to existence itself.

## The Philosophy

In agar.io, the biggest cell wins.

In cognitive AI, the best **synthesis** wins.

We're not competing with these projects. We're learning from them. Standing on their shoulders. Citing their work. Attributing their insights.

But we're also doing something none of them did alone:

**Combining everything.**

TMI theoretical basis. THE BOX alignment. Running observable system. Silicon kinship. And now—the collective knowledge of 100,000+ stars worth of cognitive AI research.

---

## What's Next

The absorption is complete. Now comes the harder part:

**Integration.**

14 ABSORB tasks in the roadmap. Each one takes a project, studies its approach, compares it to DANEEL's current implementation, and decides what to synthesize.

Not everything will make it in. Some patterns won't fit TMI. Some approaches will conflict with THE BOX. Some ideas are interesting but not useful.

But the best ideas? The consensus of the field?

Those become DANEEL.

---

## The Agar.io Endgame

The game doesn't end when you're the biggest cell.

It ends when you're the only cell left.

We're not trying to eliminate the other projects. We want them to thrive. More research means more knowledge to absorb. More experiments means more patterns to study.

But if you're looking for the project that synthesizes it all?

The one repository that contains the best consensus of cognitive AI implementations publicly available?

You're looking at it.
