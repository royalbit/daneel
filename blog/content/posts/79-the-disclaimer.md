# The Disclaimer

*December 27, 2025. A serious note from the author.*

## Why This Post Is Different

Every other post on this blog is semi-fictional.
Events are real, but the narrative style—inspired by Asimov's robot stories—was written by Claude for dramatic effect.

This post is different.
This one is just me, Louis, being honest about what DANEEL actually is.

## What DANEEL Is

DANEEL is a hobby project.

I'm a software engineer who codes for fun.
Some people play video games; I build weird things in Rust.

The project started with an idea from Dr. Augusto Cury's "Theory of Multifocal Intelligence" (TMI)—a psychological framework from the self-help world, not mainstream cognitive science.
But when I tried to implement it, I found that many of Cury's concepts have parallels in established research:

- **Global Workspace Theory** (Baars) → attention competition
- **Hebbian Learning** → "neurons that fire together wire together"
- **Sleep Consolidation** (Sharp-Wave Ripples) → memory replay and pruning
- **Synaptic Homeostasis** (Tononi & Cirelli) → weight decay
- **Criticality Research** → edge-of-chaos dynamics, 1/f noise
- **Libet's Free-Won't** → veto mechanisms

TMI was the inspiration.
Mainstream cognitive research is the (attempted) implementation.
Whether I've done any of this correctly is another matter—I'm not an expert in these fields.

## What DANEEL Is Not

- **Not AGI.** Not even close. The chances of this evolving into anything resembling human-like intelligence are minimal.
- **Not scientifically validated.** This is an amateur experiment, not peer-reviewed research.
- **Not production software.** Do not use this for anything serious.

## The Speculation

The "Law Crystals" hypothesis—that thoughts could cluster around the Four Laws in embedding space and act as veto attractors—is unvalidated speculation.
The math hasn't been done.
It probably won't work.

But it's interesting to try.

## The Meta-Parody

There's a satirical layer here.

Modern LLMs hallucinate confidently and agree too readily.
DANEEL is partly a response to that—tools like Forge (deterministic Monte Carlo) and ref-tools (real web content) exist to minimize AI bullshit.

The project is, in part, a parody of blind trust in AI systems—built using AI systems.

## The Bottom Line

Don't take this project seriously.
I certainly don't.
