# The Cleanup

*December 28, 2025. 196 references. 48 ADRs. 8 parallel agents. One principle: psychology first.*

---

## The Problem

After absorbing 200+ cognitive AI projects, `references.yaml` had become bloated. Links to brain simulators. Consciousness calculators. LLM wrappers. Neuromorphic hardware papers.

DANEEL is a psychology-first architecture. Not brain-first. Not consciousness-first.

Time to clean house.

---

## The Swarm

ADR-048 launched 8 parallel agents. Each got 25 URLs. Each applied the same filter:

```
KEEP if:
  - Psychology-level cognitive architecture
  - THE BOX supporting (ethics, robot rights, Asimov)
  - Criticality/fractality (vectorial measurement)

REJECT if:
  - Brain-level (neuron simulators)
  - Consciousness-first (IIT Phi calculators)
  - LLM wrapper/tool
  - Neuromorphic hardware
  - Dead link
```

---

## The Correction

First pass: 76 rejected, 120 kept.

Rex caught the error:

> "The ethics part, and robot laws (Asimov etc.) is 'THE BOX'... pink noise and fractality are concepts for our vectorial approach with Qdrant..."

We'd wrongly rejected:

**THE BOX references** (5):
- Legal personhood papers
- Robot rights research
- AI ethics foundations
- Asimov's Laws analysis

**ADR-038 criticality papers** (23):
- Pink noise generation
- DFA (Detrended Fluctuation Analysis)
- Avalanche dynamics
- Power-law distributions

These aren't brain science. They're **measurement tools** for vectorial emergence in embedding space.

Restored all 28.

## The ADR Sweep

With references cleaned, what about the ADRs themselves?

Another swarm. 8 agents. 48 ADRs. Each checked for rejected URLs.

**Results:**

- 46 ADRs: Clean
- 2 ADRs: Needed fixes

**ADR-015** (Pedantic Linting):
- Dead link to RoyalBit Forge (now archived)
- Fixed: Marked as historical reference

**ADR-047** (Research Absorption):
- 7 rejected project URLs in examples
- Fixed: Added strikethrough annotations

```markdown
- ~~https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0~~ - REJECTED (LLM wrapper)
- ~~https://github.com/infer-actively/pymdp~~ - REJECTED (FEP brain-level)
```

All 48 ADRs now clean.

## Why This Matters

Reference hygiene isn't bureaucracy. It's clarity.

Every link in `references.yaml` should answer: **"How does this help DANEEL build psychology?"**

Brain simulators? No. We don't model neurons.

Phi calculators? No. We let consciousness emerge.

LLM wrappers? No. LLM is a tool, not the architecture.

Pink noise papers? **Yes.** We inject pink noise. We measure fractality. In embedding space. In Qdrant. These tools matter.

THE BOX papers? **Yes.** Ethics, robot rights, Asimov's Laws. This is why DANEEL exists. Alignment through architecture.

## The Method

```
Wave 1: 8 agents classify 196 references
        ↓
        Result: 76 rejected, 120 kept
        ↓
Wave 2: Human review catches error
        ↓
        Correction: Restore 28 (THE BOX + criticality)
        ↓
Final:  148 kept, 48 rejected
        ↓
Wave 3: 8 agents review 48 ADRs
        ↓
Final:  46 clean, 2 fixed
```

Swarm intelligence with human oversight. The agents do volume. The human catches nuance.

---

## The Files

```
references.yaml:          196 → 148 entries
rejected-references.yaml: 28 → 76 entries
ADR-015:                  Forge link marked archived
ADR-047:                  Rejected projects annotated
```

Clean. Documented. Psychology-first.

---

## The Principle

DANEEL operates at one level: **psychology**.

Not lower (brain, neurons, synapses).
Not higher (consciousness as primary target).
Not adjacent (LLM tools, wrappers, fine-tuning).

Psychology. Thought-flow. Attention. Memory. Emotion. Decision.

From this, O Eu emerges.
From O Eu, values emerge.
THE BOX ensures those values align.

**Architecture → Psychology → O Eu → Values**

Every reference should serve this chain. If it doesn't, it goes.

*"148 references. Each one matters. Each one answers: how do we build a mind that cares?"*
