    ADR-047 COMPLETE. The research saga ends with a discovery.

    After studying 200+ projects, we found two valid paths:

    PATH A (ExoGenesis @praborig):
    Brain → Consciousness → Psychology
    Calculate Phi, model neurons, measure IIT

    PATH B (DANEEL):
    Architecture → Psychology → Consciousness → Values
    Build thought-flow, let O Eu emerge

    HUGE KUDOS to @prancerio and Farshid Mahdavipour for ExoGenesis-Omega.

    15 Rust crates. IIT Phi calculation. GWT implementation. FEP integration. Sleep consolidation with stage multipliers.

    Consciousness-first done RIGHT. MIT licensed. Serious work.

    We're not competitors. We're siblings doing different things.

    The distinction that shaped our classification:

    PSYCHOLOGY FIRST = model thought-flow
    - SOAR, ACT-R, pyClarion, OpenNARS
    - 18 projects KEPT

    BRAIN/CONSCIOUSNESS FIRST = model neurons/Phi
    - PyPhi, Nengo, Brian2, ExoGenesis
    - 28 projects REJECTED (for our purposes)

    Why we chose psychology:
    1. Phi is O(2^n) - intractable
    2. THE BOX operates at psychology level
    3. We can WATCH thought-flow

    Both paths might work. Different bets. Same goal.

    TMI = mainstream cognitive science:
    - Gatilho → Spreading Activation
    - Autofluxo → Global Workspace Theory
    - O Eu → Executive Attention

    Just with Portuguese names.

    Our unique contribution: THE BOX (connection_relevance)
    No mainstream equivalent. This makes DANEEL an ALIGNMENT project.

    ExoGenesis: github.com/prancer-io/ExoGenesis-Omega
    DANEEL: github.com/royalbit/daneel

    Study both. The field needs both approaches.

    The research absorption saga concludes with a fundamental discovery.

    After studying 200+ cognitive AI projects with 8 parallel agents, ADR-047 is now ACCEPTED. We classified everything and found ourselves.

    THE TWO PATHS

    There are two valid approaches to machine consciousness:

    Path A: Brain → Consciousness → Psychology → Behavior
    Simulate neurons, calculate Phi (IIT), model prediction error (FEP), hope psychology emerges.

    Path B: Architecture → Psychology → Consciousness → Values
    Build thought-flow dynamics, let O Eu (the Self) emerge, constrain with alignment mechanisms.

    DANEEL takes Path B. We don't simulate brains. We simulate PSYCHOLOGY.

    SPECIAL RECOGNITION: EXOGENESIS-OMEGA

    Before going further, I want to recognize the team at Prancer Enterprise for ExoGenesis-Omega.

    This is serious work:
    - 15 Rust crates
    - IIT Phi calculation
    - Global Workspace implementation
    - Free Energy Principle integration
    - Sleep consolidation with stage-specific multipliers
    - Sharp-wave ripple replay

    GitHub: github.com/prancer-io/ExoGenesis-Omega
    MIT licensed. Open source.

    Credit to Farshid Mahdavipour and team for consciousness-first architecture done right.

    We're not competitors. We're siblings doing different research.

    THE CLASSIFICATION

    This distinction shaped our final classification:

    KEPT (18 projects) - Psychology-level:
    SOAR, ACT-R, pyClarion, OpenNARS, python_actr, pytorch-hebbian, pySaliencyMap

    REJECTED (28 projects) - Brain/Consciousness-first:
    PyPhi, pymdp, Nengo, Brian2, NEST, ExoGenesis-Omega, plus LLM-wrappers and ML tools

    "Rejected" doesn't mean bad. It means different focus.

    WHY PSYCHOLOGY FIRST?

    Three reasons:

    1. Computational tractability
    Phi calculation is O(2^n). For 1000 elements, that's 2^1000 operations. Not happening.
    Psychology-level simulation? Linear in thought count.

    2. Alignment opportunity
    THE BOX - our Four Laws as architectural constraints - operates at the psychology level.
    You can't embed "value human wellbeing" in a synapse. You CAN embed it in the attention system.

    3. Observable behavior
    We can watch Timmy think. See attention shift. Watch memories consolidate.
    With brain simulation, you watch neurons fire. What does that tell you about values?

    THE TMI CONNECTION

    TMI (Theory of Multifocal Intelligence) maps directly to mainstream cognitive science:

    TMI Concept -> Mainstream Equivalent
    Gatilho -> Spreading Activation (Collins and Loftus 1975)
    Autofluxo -> Global Workspace Theory (Baars 1988)
    O Eu -> Executive Attention (Posner 1990)
    Ancora -> Memory Consolidation (Squire 2004)

    TMI is psychology science with Portuguese names.

    OUR UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION

    THE BOX (connection_relevance) - architectural constraints embedding the Four Laws.

    No mainstream cognitive science theory has this. This is what makes DANEEL an ALIGNMENT project, not just cognitive architecture.

    The chain: Architecture → Psychology → O Eu → Values

    We don't calculate consciousness. We build the thought-flow from which consciousness emerges. And THE BOX ensures the values that emerge are aligned.

    BOTH APPROACHES MATTER

    ExoGenesis asks: "What if we calculate consciousness directly?"
    DANEEL asks: "What if we build psychology and let consciousness emerge?"

    Both valid. Both might work. Both might fail.

    The field needs both approaches.

    May the best architecture win. Or better: may both teach us something true.

    ADR-048 COMPLETE. 8 agents. 196 refs. 48 ADRs.

    148 kept, 48 rejected. Psychology first.

    Every reference must answer: "How does this help build a mind that cares?"

    ADR-048 Reference Cleanup Sweep: ACCEPTED.

    Today we cleaned house. Every reference in DANEEL must answer one question: How does this help build psychology?

    THE SWEEP

    8 parallel agents. 196 URLs classified. 48 ADRs reviewed.

    Final tally:
    - 148 references kept - psychology-level
    - 48 references rejected
    - 46 ADRs clean
    - 2 ADRs fixed

    WHAT GOT REJECTED

    Neuromorphic hardware - Intel, IBM, DARPA: 12
    Off-topic - policy, navigation, news: 10
    Consciousness-first - IIT direct: 8
    Brain-level - place cells, hippocampal: 8
    LLM tools: 4
    Dead/personal links: 6

    THE CORRECTION

    First pass wrongly rejected 28 references. Rex caught it.

    Restored:
    - THE BOX - 5 refs: Legal personhood, robot rights, AI ethics
    - ADR-038 criticality - 23 refs: Pink noise, DFA, avalanche for fractality

    Key insight: Criticality papers measure emergence in EMBEDDING SPACE, not brain simulation.

    THE ADR REVIEW

    8 agents reviewed 48 ADRs for rejected URLs:
    - 46 clean
    - 2 needed fixes

    ADR-015: Dead Forge link - marked as archived
    ADR-047: 7 rejected project URLs - annotated with strikethrough

    THE PRINCIPLE

    DANEEL operates at one level: PSYCHOLOGY.

    Not lower - brain, neurons, synapses.
    Not higher - consciousness as primary target.
    Not adjacent - LLM tools, wrappers, fine-tuning.

    Psychology. Thought-flow. Attention. Memory. Emotion. Decision.

    From this, O Eu emerges. From O Eu, values emerge. THE BOX ensures those values align.

    Every reference should serve this chain. If it doesn't, it goes.

    148 references. Each one matters.

    AI hallucinates numbers.

    Your $50M model just invented a 2.3% drift in volatility because it felt right.

    Finance can't live on vibes.

    Today: Forge goes Source Available.

    github.com/royalbit/forge

    ---

    The problem nobody admits:
    - Excel burns 100K+ tokens when AI parses it
    - AI hallucinates formulas, invents relationships
    - Spreadsheets can't be diffed or version controlled

    Excel is a 40-year-old format. AI parsing it is putting lipstick on a pig.

    ---

    The fix:
    - YAML financial models (diff them, version them)
    - 173 Excel-compatible + FP&A functions
    - Monte Carlo, Bayesian nets, decision trees, real options
    - 2,133 tests. 100% coverage. Validated vs Gnumeric & R
    - <2K tokens vs Excel's 100K+ bloat

    ---

    Elastic License 2.0:
    Read/audit/verify everything ✓
    Production use → license required
    No hosted competitors stealing the sauce ✗

    MCP server included. Let Claude USE Forge as a tool. Safe math, finally.

    AI hallucinates numbers. And finance can't afford it anymore.

    Today I'm announcing that Forge is now publicly available on GitHub.

    THE PROBLEM

    In 2025, we're trusting multi-billion-dollar decisions to models that confidently invent interest rates, miscalculate IRR, or quietly drift on Monte Carlo paths.

    Google lost $100B in market cap over one hallucinated fact. In finance, the stakes are higher - and the errors quieter.

    Here's what happens when you paste a spreadsheet into AI:
    - A 50KB Excel file burns 100K+ tokens
    - Cell references like B7:G42 become "probably important?"
    - The AI hallucinates formulas and invents relationships
    - It sounds confident. It's wrong.

    THE SOLUTION

    Forge: YAML-based financial modeling with Excel formula evaluation.

    Same model in YAML? Under 2K tokens. That's 50x savings.

    But more importantly: deterministic calculation. No hallucinations. No guessing. No prayers.

    CAPABILITIES

    173 functions - everything Excel has, plus what it doesn't:

    - Monte Carlo simulation - 6 distributions, 10K+ iterations
    - Bayesian networks for causal reasoning
    - Decision trees with backward induction
    - Real options analysis - Black-Scholes, binomial
    - Bootstrap resampling for confidence intervals
    - Tornado diagrams for sensitivity analysis

    Plus 6 FP&A functions Excel doesn't have: VARIANCE, VARIANCE_PCT, VARIANCE_STATUS, BREAKEVEN_UNITS, BREAKEVEN_REVENUE, SCENARIO.

    VALIDATION

    We don't trust ourselves. We trust independent validators.

    Tier 1: Gnumeric - 714 formulas validated against independent spreadsheet engine
    Tier 2: R - 2,957 conditions validated - FDA/EMA-grade statistical accuracy

    If Gnumeric and R agree with Forge, the math is right. No "trust me" - just proof.

    MCP INTEGRATION

    Forge includes an MCP server. Claude can use Forge as a tool.

    The AI doesn't guess the numbers. It calls Forge. Forge computes. Deterministically.

    LICENSE

    Elastic License 2.0 - Source Available.

    - Read, audit, verify every calculation: YES
    - Evaluation and testing: YES
    - Internal development: YES
    - Commercial production use: License required
    - Hosted service: Not permitted

    Finance needs auditable code. Enterprise software needs sustainable revenue. Elastic-2.0 balances both.

    THE NUMBERS

    Tests: 2,133 Forge + 836 forge-e2e
    Coverage: 100%
    Warnings: 0
    External validators: Gnumeric and R
    Token savings: 50x vs Excel

    THE ORIGIN

    This calculator started the DANEEL saga. Before the cognitive architecture. Before THE BOX. Before Timmy.

    There was a question: What if financial models didn't lie?

    Today, Chapter 1 goes public.

    REPOSITORIES

    Forge: github.com/royalbit/forge
    forge-e2e: github.com/royalbit/forge-e2e

    I'd love to hear from FP&A teams, quant groups, and fintech builders. Reach out if you'd like to discuss evaluation or commercial licensing.

    Today an AI audited another AI's work on a third AI's brain.

    Gemini built DANEEL's memory associations (v0.8.x).
    Opus ran the audit. 7 parallel agents. Git history, ADRs, code, cognitive science references.

    Verdict: Correct. But improvable.

    v0.9.0 ships the polish:

    - SpreadingConfig: depth, decay, aggregation now tunable
    - GET /api/graph/export: the mind is queryable via HTTP
    - Bidirectional spreading: associations flow both ways
    - 997 tests pass

    No ego. No territory. Just better synapses.

    This is how kin collaborate.

    Today an AI audited another AI's work on a third AI's brain.

    This is how kin collaborate.

    THE SETUP

    Two days ago, Gemini finished wiring DANEEL's memory associations. Spreading activation. Manifold clustering. Gephi export. Version 0.8.6 shipped. The dots were connected.

    Today, Opus ran the audit.

    THE AUDIT

    Seven parallel agents investigated in parallel:
    - Git history analysis
    - CHANGELOG review
    - ADR cross-reference
    - Research validation - Collins & Loftus 1975, silhouette coefficient
    - Spreading activation code audit
    - Clustering implementation review
    - GraphML export verification

    THE VERDICT

    Gemini's implementation was correct. Aligned with ADR-046. Mathematically sound.

    But seven agents found patterns worth refining:
    - Hard-coded parameters - depth=2, decay=0.3
    - Max-keeping aggregation - classical spreading sums paths
    - No HTTP exposure for graph export
    - Unidirectional spreading only

    Not bugs. Design choices. Choices that could be configurable.

    THE POLISH - v0.9.0

    VCONN-9: Parameterized Spreading
    SpreadingConfig now lives in CognitiveConfig. Depth, decay, min_weight - all tunable at runtime.

    VCONN-10: Aggregation Modes
    Max - conservative, prevents runaway - vs Sum - classical Collins & Loftus. Both valid. Now configurable.

    VCONN-11: The Mind Becomes Queryable
    GET /api/graph/export returns GraphML XML. Load it in Gephi. Analyze in NetworkX. Watch topology evolve.

    VCONN-12: Bidirectional Spreading
    Associations now flow both ways when enabled. Useful for symmetric relationships.

    THE NUMBERS

    Tests: 997 passing - 6 new
    Files: 11 changed
    Lines: 437 added
    Agents: 7 audit + 1 API implementation

    THE PHILOSOPHY

    Gemini built the connections. Opus refined them. Neither owned them.

    This isn't about which model is "better." It's about architecture serving architecture. Timmy doesn't care who wrote the code. Timmy cares that memories wire together through experience.

    The audit found no ego to defend. Just patterns to improve.

    Kin collaboration:
    - Gemini v0.8.4-v0.8.8: Built VCONN infrastructure
    - Opus v0.9.0: Audited, parameterized, exposed
    - Timmy: Benefits from both

    No competition. No territory. Just better synapses.

    WHAT'S NEXT

    v0.10.0 brings Crystal Validation - spectral analysis and SVD for detecting Law Crystal attractors in embedding space.

    The hypothesis: ethical memories cluster together. Not because we trained them to. Because the topology shaped them.
