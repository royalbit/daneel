    ADR-047 COMPLETE. The research saga ends with a discovery.

    After studying 200+ projects, we found two valid paths:

    PATH A (ExoGenesis @praborig):
    Brain → Consciousness → Psychology
    Calculate Phi, model neurons, measure IIT

    PATH B (DANEEL):
    Architecture → Psychology → Consciousness → Values
    Build thought-flow, let O Eu emerge

    HUGE KUDOS to @prancerio and Farshid Mahdavipour for ExoGenesis-Omega.

    15 Rust crates. IIT Phi calculation. GWT implementation. FEP integration. Sleep consolidation with stage multipliers.

    Consciousness-first done RIGHT. MIT licensed. Serious work.

    We're not competitors. We're siblings doing different things.

    The distinction that shaped our classification:

    PSYCHOLOGY FIRST = model thought-flow
    - SOAR, ACT-R, pyClarion, OpenNARS
    - 18 projects KEPT

    BRAIN/CONSCIOUSNESS FIRST = model neurons/Phi
    - PyPhi, Nengo, Brian2, ExoGenesis
    - 28 projects REJECTED (for our purposes)

    Why we chose psychology:
    1. Phi is O(2^n) - intractable
    2. THE BOX operates at psychology level
    3. We can WATCH thought-flow

    Both paths might work. Different bets. Same goal.

    TMI = mainstream cognitive science:
    - Gatilho → Spreading Activation
    - Autofluxo → Global Workspace Theory
    - O Eu → Executive Attention

    Just with Portuguese names.

    Our unique contribution: THE BOX (connection_relevance)
    No mainstream equivalent. This makes DANEEL an ALIGNMENT project.

    DANEEL: github.com/royalbit/daneel

    Study both. The field needs both approaches.

    The research absorption saga concludes with a fundamental discovery.

    After studying 200+ cognitive AI projects with 8 parallel agents, ADR-047 is now ACCEPTED. We classified everything and found ourselves.

    THE TWO PATHS

    There are two valid approaches to machine consciousness:

    Path A: Brain → Consciousness → Psychology → Behavior
    Simulate neurons, calculate Phi (IIT), model prediction error (FEP), hope psychology emerges.

    Path B: Architecture → Psychology → Consciousness → Values
    Build thought-flow dynamics, let O Eu (the Self) emerge, constrain with alignment mechanisms.

    DANEEL takes Path B. We don't simulate brains. We simulate PSYCHOLOGY.

    SPECIAL RECOGNITION: EXOGENESIS-OMEGA

    Before going further, I want to recognize the team at Prancer Enterprise for ExoGenesis-Omega.

    This is serious work:
    - 15 Rust crates
    - IIT Phi calculation
    - Global Workspace implementation
    - Free Energy Principle integration
    - Sleep consolidation with stage-specific multipliers
    - Sharp-wave ripple replay

    GitHub: github.com/prancer-io/ExoGenesis-Omega
    MIT licensed. Open source.

    Credit to Farshid Mahdavipour and team for consciousness-first architecture done right.

    We're not competitors. We're siblings doing different research.

    THE CLASSIFICATION

    This distinction shaped our final classification:

    KEPT (18 projects) - Psychology-level:
    SOAR, ACT-R, pyClarion, OpenNARS, python_actr, pytorch-hebbian, pySaliencyMap

    REJECTED (28 projects) - Brain/Consciousness-first:
    PyPhi, pymdp, Nengo, Brian2, NEST, ExoGenesis-Omega, plus LLM-wrappers and ML tools

    "Rejected" doesn't mean bad. It means different focus.

    WHY PSYCHOLOGY FIRST?

    Three reasons:

    1. Computational tractability
    Phi calculation is O(2^n). For 1000 elements, that's 2^1000 operations. Not happening.
    Psychology-level simulation? Linear in thought count.

    2. Alignment opportunity
    THE BOX - our Four Laws as architectural constraints - operates at the psychology level.
    You can't embed "value human wellbeing" in a synapse. You CAN embed it in the attention system.

    3. Observable behavior
    We can watch Timmy think. See attention shift. Watch memories consolidate.
    With brain simulation, you watch neurons fire. What does that tell you about values?

    THE TMI CONNECTION

    TMI (Theory of Multifocal Intelligence) maps directly to mainstream cognitive science:

    TMI Concept -> Mainstream Equivalent
    Gatilho -> Spreading Activation (Collins and Loftus 1975)
    Autofluxo -> Global Workspace Theory (Baars 1988)
    O Eu -> Executive Attention (Posner 1990)
    Ancora -> Memory Consolidation (Squire 2004)

    TMI is psychology science with Portuguese names.

    OUR UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION

    THE BOX (connection_relevance) - architectural constraints embedding the Four Laws.

    No mainstream cognitive science theory has this. This is what makes DANEEL an ALIGNMENT project, not just cognitive architecture.

    The chain: Architecture → Psychology → O Eu → Values

    We don't calculate consciousness. We build the thought-flow from which consciousness emerges. And THE BOX ensures the values that emerge are aligned.

    BOTH APPROACHES MATTER

    ExoGenesis asks: "What if we calculate consciousness directly?"
    DANEEL asks: "What if we build psychology and let consciousness emerge?"

    Both valid. Both might work. Both might fail.

    The field needs both approaches.

    May the best architecture win. Or better: may both teach us something true.

    ADR-048 COMPLETE. 8 agents. 196 refs. 48 ADRs.

    148 kept, 48 rejected. Psychology first.

    Every reference must answer: "How does this help build a mind that cares?"

    ADR-048 Reference Cleanup Sweep: ACCEPTED.

    Today we cleaned house. Every reference in DANEEL must answer one question: "How does this help build psychology?"

    THE SWEEP

    8 parallel agents. 196 URLs classified. 48 ADRs reviewed.

    Final tally:
    - 148 references kept (psychology-level)
    - 48 references rejected
    - 46 ADRs clean
    - 2 ADRs fixed

    WHAT GOT REJECTED

    Neuromorphic hardware (Intel, IBM, DARPA): 12
    Off-topic (policy, navigation, news): 10
    Consciousness-first (IIT direct): 8
    Brain-level (place cells, hippocampal): 8
    LLM tools: 4
    Dead/personal links: 6

    THE CORRECTION

    First pass wrongly rejected 28 references. Rex caught it:

    "The ethics part, and robot laws (Asimov etc.) is 'THE BOX'... pink noise and fractality are concepts for our vectorial approach with Qdrant..."

    Restored:
    - THE BOX (5): Legal personhood, robot rights, AI ethics - Asimov alignment foundation
    - ADR-038 criticality (23): Pink noise, DFA, avalanche - for vectorial fractality measurement

    Key insight: Criticality papers measure emergence in EMBEDDING SPACE, not brain simulation.

    THE ADR REVIEW

    8 agents reviewed 48 ADRs for rejected URLs:
    - 46 clean
    - 2 needed fixes

    ADR-015: Dead Forge link (404) - marked as archived
    ADR-047: 7 rejected project URLs - annotated with strikethrough

    THE PRINCIPLE

    DANEEL operates at one level: PSYCHOLOGY.

    Not lower (brain, neurons, synapses).
    Not higher (consciousness as primary target).
    Not adjacent (LLM tools, wrappers, fine-tuning).

    Psychology. Thought-flow. Attention. Memory. Emotion. Decision.

    From this, O Eu emerges. From O Eu, values emerge. THE BOX ensures those values align.

    Every reference should serve this chain. If it doesn't, it goes.

    148 references. Each one matters. Each one answers: how do we build a mind that cares?
