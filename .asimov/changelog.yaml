# =============================================================================
# v0.8.0 - External Stimuli Injection (WIP - Dec 22, 2025)
# =============================================================================

    # ADR-043: Noise Injection Correction (Unpause)
    noise_injection_correction:
      status: done

      description: |
        Discovered ADR-042 pause was asking the wrong question.
        White noise (rand::rng) cannot produce criticality - research (ADR-038) said so.
        1/f pink noise is REQUIRED for edge of chaos dynamics.
        ROADMAP UNPAUSED. Next: implement pink noise injector.
      key_insight: "Closed deterministic systems converge to limit cycles. No noise = clockwork forever."

        WatchDog attack exposed Servarica weaknesses (42% fraud score, no certs).
        Decision: Migrate Timmy to Mac mini + Cloudflare Tunnel.
        $216/year savings. Better security. Full control.
      cost_comparison:
        servarica: "$240/year"
        mac_mini_cloudflare: "$24/year (electricity only)"
        savings: "$216/year"

        Original plan: Harden Servarica VPS (Redis auth, Qdrant auth, SSH, Caddy headers).
        SUPERSEDED: Mac mini + Cloudflare Tunnel migration makes most items N/A.
        - NAT + macOS firewall + Cloudflare Tunnel = no public exposure
        - Only localhost:3000 exposed via tunnel
        - No need for service-level auth (Redis/Qdrant localhost only)
        - No SSH exposure, no Caddy (Cloudflare handles TLS)
      completed:

      not_applicable:
        - "HARDEN-2 through HARDEN-8: Superseded by infrastructure migration"

        Discovered TUI and Web calculated entropy differently - both WRONG.
        4 research agents analyzed literature (Carhart-Harris, Baars, Cury).
        Fix: TMI-aligned calculation with emotional_intensity as PRIMARY.
      changes:
        - "TMI composite: emotional_intensity (40%) + cognitive (30%) + novelty (20%) + connection (10%)"
        - "5 categorical bins (MINIMAL/LOW/MODERATE/HIGH/INTENSE) instead of 10"

          Cornell requires endorsement - gatekept bureaucracy.
          We're building faster than they can review.
          The seed is planted: LinkedIn, X, LessWrong.
          We have ref-tools for fact-checking, Forge for calculations.
          No time to wait for PhDs or big labs with Brooks' Law coordination.
          We're faster and better without them.
