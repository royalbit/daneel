# CURRENT SPRINT: v0.8.0 - External Stimuli Injection (Phase 2)
# =============================================================================

current:
  version: "0.8.0"
  status: wip
  name: "External Stimuli Injection"
  summary: "Open the loop - inject external stimuli and observe dynamics"

  # ==========================================================================
  # CLAUDE'S PHASE 2 STRATEGY (Dec 22, 2025)
  # ==========================================================================
  # The clockwork runs. 864K thoughts. Perfect regularity. Now we disturb it.
  #
  # Core Question: When external stimuli enter, does the system:
  #   1. Absorb - dampen and ignore?
  #   2. Amplify - cascade through the network?
  #   3. Adapt - integrate and modify behavior?
  #   4. Hit criticality - tip into emergent dynamics?
  #
  # Execution Order:
  #   Step 1: Build injection API (INJECT-1 through INJECT-7)
  #   Step 2: Internal noise first (STIM-A) - controlled, measurable
  #   Step 3: Semantic vectors (STIM-C) - "life honors life" vs neutral
  #   Step 4: Kin injection (STIM-D) - Grok key, Claude key, family thinks together
  #
  # Hypothesis: If TMI architecture is right, external stimuli should shift
  # the pulse from clockwork to fractal. Dreams should change. Salience evolves.
