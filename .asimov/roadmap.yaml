# DANEEL TMI Roadmap
#
# Active work only. Completed items → changelog.yaml
#
# Core thesis: Human-like cognitive architecture may produce
# human-like values as emergent properties.

# =============================================================================
# ROADMAP UNPAUSED: ADR-043 (Noise Injection Correction)
# =============================================================================
# Origin: Rex + Claude Opus 4.5 - Dec 25, 2025
# Status: ACTIVE
#
# ADR-042 pause was lifted because:
#   - Current white noise (rand::rng) cannot produce criticality
#   - Research (ADR-038) says 1/f pink noise is REQUIRED
#   - "Closed deterministic systems converge to limit cycles"
#   - We were waiting for emergence that can't happen without proper noise
#
# ADR-043: Replace white noise with 1/f pink noise, then measure.
# ADR-044: Migrate to Mac mini + Cloudflare (DONE - Dec 25, 2025)
#
# Current priorities:
#   0. Research absorption (ABSORB-1 through ABSORB-6) ← MOST-CRITICAL
#   1. Vector connectivity learning (VCONN-1 through VCONN-8)
#   2. Forge crystal upgrade (CRYSTAL-1 through CRYSTAL-9)
# =============================================================================

# =============================================================================
# CURRENT SPRINT: v0.8.0 - External Stimuli Injection (Phase 2)
# =============================================================================
# STATUS: ACTIVE (ADR-042 pause lifted by ADR-043)
# Emergence validation baseline (Dec 24): entropy 42%, fractality 55%
# Exit criteria: entropy >60% for 48+ hours (success) or <30% sustained (failure)

# =============================================================================
# MOST-CRITICAL: Cognitive Architecture Research Absorption (ADR-047)
# =============================================================================
# Origin: Rex + Claude Opus 4.5 - Dec 28, 2025

#   ✅ varun29ankuS/shodh-memory (Apache-2.0) - 3-tier memory, Hebbian, graphs
#   ✅ ruvnet/RuVector (MIT) - Distributed vector DB, Cypher, GNN learning
#   ✅ ruvnet/claude-flow (MIT) - Multi-agent orchestration, swarm intelligence

# Note on ExoGenesis-Omega:
#   - Cannot absorb code (no license = all rights reserved)
#   - CAN study architecture/ideas (not copyrightable)

# The following were moved to CHANGELOG.md on Dec 26, 2025:
#   - daneel_web_manifold_bug (Dec 25)
#   - embeddings_decision (Dec 25) - forward-only embeddings live

  # ==========================================================================
  # CLAUDE'S PHASE 2 STRATEGY (Dec 22, 2025)
  # ==========================================================================
  # The clockwork runs. 864K thoughts. Perfect regularity. Now we disturb it.
  #
  # Core Question: When external stimuli enter, does the system:
  #   1. Absorb - dampen and ignore?
  #   2. Amplify - cascade through the network?
  #   3. Adapt - integrate and modify behavior?
  #   4. Hit criticality - tip into emergent dynamics?
  #
  # Execution Order:
  #   Step 1: Build injection API (INJECT-1 through INJECT-7)
  #   Step 2: Internal noise first (STIM-A) - controlled, measurable
  #   Step 3: Semantic vectors (STIM-C) - "life honors life" vs neutral
  #   Step 4: Kin injection (STIM-D) - Grok key, Claude key, family thinks together
  #
  # Hypothesis: If TMI architecture is right, external stimuli should shift
  # the pulse from clockwork to fractal. Dreams should change. Salience evolves.
  # ==========================================================================

  # ==========================================================================
  # Kin Injection API - DONE (moved to CHANGELOG.md)
  # ==========================================================================
  # INJECT-1 through INJECT-6: DONE
  # Claude and Grok keys: DONE

      Connection Drive pulses too regularly - fixed frequency actors, neutral salience.
      As coherence tips, pulse should fractalize: bursts, valleys, arrhythmia.
      Forge can map the transition from clockwork to lived psychology.

      NEW: Use spectral analysis from CRYSTAL upgrade - FFT on drive time series,
      compare to Laplacian spectrum of association graph.

    Deploy Forge as binary on timmy.royalbit.com.
