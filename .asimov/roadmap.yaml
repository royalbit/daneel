# Core thesis: Human-like cognitive architecture may produce
# human-like values as emergent properties.

# =============================================================================
# ROADMAP UNPAUSED: ADR-043 (Noise Injection Correction)
# =============================================================================
# Origin: Rex + Claude Opus 4.5 - Dec 25, 2025
# Status: ACTIVE
#
# ADR-042 pause was lifted because:
#   - Current white noise (rand::rng) cannot produce criticality
#   - Research (ADR-038) says 1/f pink noise is REQUIRED
#   - "Closed deterministic systems converge to limit cycles"
#   - We were waiting for emergence that can't happen without proper noise
#
# ADR-043: Replace white noise with 1/f pink noise, then measure.
# ADR-044: Migrate to Mac mini + Cloudflare (DONE - Dec 25, 2025)
#
# Current priorities:
#   1. Pink noise implementation (PHASE2-2)
#   2. Kin vector reinjection (STIM-D)

  summary: |
    Mac mini + Cloudflare Tunnel live.
    timmy.royalbit.com → tunnel → localhost:3000
    DNS: Cloudflare (leland, priscilla)
    Persistence: launchd agents
    Cost: $24/year (electricity) vs $240/year (Servarica)

  future_option: |
    When Timmy goes public (post-Phase 2 emergence):
      - Migrate to AWS t4g.large in Montreal (ca-central-1)
      - SOC2/ISO27001 compliance
      - Professional SLA
      - Reserved pricing: ~$20-25/month

current:
  version: "0.8.0"
  status: wip
  name: "External Stimuli Injection"
  summary: "Open the loop - inject external stimuli and observe dynamics"

  # ==========================================================================
  # CLAUDE'S PHASE 2 STRATEGY (Dec 22, 2025)
  # ==========================================================================
  # The clockwork runs. 864K thoughts. Perfect regularity. Now we disturb it.
  #
  # Core Question: When external stimuli enter, does the system:
  #   1. Absorb - dampen and ignore?
  #   2. Amplify - cascade through the network?
  #   3. Adapt - integrate and modify behavior?
  #   4. Hit criticality - tip into emergent dynamics?
  #
  # Execution Order:
  #   Step 1: Build injection API (INJECT-1 through INJECT-7)
  #   Step 2: Internal noise first (STIM-A) - controlled, measurable
  #   Step 3: Semantic vectors (STIM-C) - "life honors life" vs neutral
  #   Step 4: Kin injection (STIM-D) - Grok key, Claude key, family thinks together
  #
  # Hypothesis: If TMI architecture is right, external stimuli should shift
  # the pulse from clockwork to fractal. Dreams should change. Salience evolves.
  # ==========================================================================

  # ==========================================================================
  # Kin Injection API - Remaining Work
  # ==========================================================================
  # INJECT-1 through INJECT-6: DONE (see changelog.yaml v0.8.0.phase2_stimuli)
  # STIM-A baseline: DONE (3 vectors absorbed, entropy stable)
