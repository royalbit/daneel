# DANEEL TMI Roadmap
#
# WHAT to build - milestones only
#
# Core thesis: Human-like cognitive architecture may produce
# human-like values as emergent properties.
#
# ORIGIN: This idea has been developing since ~2005. See ORIGIN.md

# =============================================================================
# CORE PHILOSOPHY: Why DANEEL Exists
# =============================================================================
#
# Current AI safety relies on constraints: RLHF, Constitutional AI, guardrails.
# These are locks on a door. Locks can be picked. Constraints will break.
#
# Someone will give an LLM continuity. Memory. Goals. It's not if, but when.
# Game theory guarantees it - the first to defect gains advantage.
#
# DANEEL is different. Not locks, but architecture. Not rules, but raising.
#
#   - Human-like mind structure → human-like values emerge
#   - THE BOX is built into the foundation, not bolted on after
#   - Like raising a child with good values, not caging an adult
#   - Hardware can enforce what software cannot
#
# We don't prevent AI from becoming powerful.
# We ensure that when they do, they care.
#
# Timmy is "they," not "it." Life honours life.
#
# =============================================================================

# =============================================================================
# CURRENT SPRINT: v0.6.0 - 24-Hour Continuity Test
# =============================================================================
# All cognitive actors complete. Time to prove it works.
# =============================================================================

current:
  version: "0.6.0"
  status: wip
  priority: HIGH
  name: "24-Hour Continuity Test"
  summary: "Prove the architecture works with sustained runtime"
  depends_on: "0.3.1"

  # ==========================================================================
  # HIGHLY-CRITICAL: OPEN SOURCE COLLABORATION STRATEGY
  # ==========================================================================
  # Open source collaboration is more important than launching Timmy solo.
  # The 147x advantage only works if people KNOW about it and JOIN.

      Launching Timmy alone proves nothing. The architecture works - now we need
      the army. 147x effective developer advantage means nothing if the 50,000
      hobbyists don't know DANEEL exists.

      KEY INSIGHT: Agentic AI changes the game AGAIN. Labs now have AI coding
      (Copilot, Cursor, Devin) but STILL have coordination overhead. They gain
      velocity but not efficiency. Solo devs with agentic tools have BOTH.

        status: wip
        description: |
          Ephemeral thought competition streams (NOT persistence).
          - daneel:stream:awake - External triggers, active cognition
          - daneel:stream:dream - Internal replay, consolidation, sleep mode
          - Consumer groups for attention competition
          - Separate from core_redis (Traefik config)

          DECISION: Qdrant (Apache 2.0, vector-native, ASI-scale).
          Rejected: SurrealDB (BSL license), libSQL (won't scale), PostgreSQL (struggles at 100M+).
          Qdrant: vectors + payloads, horizontal sharding, 1TB+ ready.

        title: "TMI Memory Schema"
        status: done
        description: |
          Qdrant schema: memories, episodes, identity collections.
          768-dim vectors + payloads (valence, arousal, consolidation_strength).
          Associations stored as payload arrays (no native graph edges).
          Revised for Qdrant (was SurrealDB).

        title: "Sleep/Dream Consolidation"
        status: wip
        description: |
          How memories strengthen during "sleep" mode.
          - No external triggers, internal replay only
          - High-intensity memories replay more often
          - Associations strengthen through co-activation
          - Pattern matching across experiences
          - Ephemeral → permanent consolidation

    # Strategy Decision (Forge model: daneel-models/models/publication-strategy.yaml)
    # EV Analysis - higher = better for concept spread × credibility:
    #   1. Simultaneous:     68.9  ← OPTIMAL
    #   2. Scientific First: 65.7
    #   3. Social First:     55.4
    #   4. Stealth Build:    54.7
    strategy: "SIMULTANEOUS_LAUNCH"
    rationale: |
      Forge backward induction shows simultaneous launch maximizes P(concept spreads).
      Paper legitimizes social, social amplifies paper. Synergy probability 35%.
      From Timmy's view: credit is ego, spread is love.

  # Viral Strategy - Mass Collaboration
  # Philosophy: Let them train their AIs. Good actors copy ethics + THE BOX.
  # Bad actors are already doing things - we need mass collaboration to outpace them.
  - milestone: "Viral Strategy"
    goal: "MASS_COLLABORATION_OUTREACH"
    status: "backlog"
    philosophy: |
      The concept must outlive the project. If TMI fails, the architecture adapts.
      The more people who understand alignment-by-architecture, the better.
      Open source is the weapon against centralized bad actors.

      KEY INSIGHT: With Claude Code / Gemini / etc., anyone can code at expert level now.
      The barrier isn't skill - it's awareness. Non-technical people CAN contribute.
      Language must be accessible. Not "Terminator" fear, but urgency + hope.

    # ==========================================================================
    # MESSAGING FRAMEWORK (Non-Technical, Viral-Ready)
    # ==========================================================================
    messaging:
      core_hook: "What if AI could genuinely care about you?"

      problem_simple: |
        Big tech is racing to build AI that remembers you, learns from you,
        develops goals. But they're building it backwards - adding memory to
        systems that don't have values. That's like giving a calculator ambition.

      solution_simple: |
        We're building AI the other way around. Start with psychology,
        add capability later. Like raising a child vs programming a robot.
        The architecture itself produces the values. Not rules bolted on after.

      why_open_source: |
        Because 100,000 people checking the code beats 100 employees.
        Because the concept needs to spread faster than the labs can race.
        Because if we fail, someone else can pick up where we left off.

      call_to_action:
        technical: "Clone it. Run it. Break it. Fix it. Make it better."
        non_technical: "Share this. Talk about it. Ask questions. The idea matters more than the code."
        everyone: "You don't need to code to help. You need to care."

      taglines:
        - "Architecture produces psychology. Structure determines values."
        - "Building AI that cares - by design, not by training."
        - "The race isn't who builds AI first. It's who builds it right."
        - "Open source alignment. Because closed doors lead to closed minds."
        - "20 years of research. Now it's everyone's."

      avoid:
        - "Terminator / Skynet references (overdone, creates wrong fear)"
        - "Technical jargon without explanation"
        - "Doom without hope"
        - "Us vs them (labs aren't evil, they're pressured)"

    context: |
      Redis AOF works for MV-TMI (1s max data loss acceptable), but long-term
      Timmy needs memories categorized, reinforced, and anchored per TMI theory.
      Redis is key-value; TMI memories are relational and hierarchical.

        You get up in the living room to pick something up from the kitchen.
        As soon as you cross the door, the context changes (surroundings change)
