# =============================================================================
# CURRENT: v0.10.0 - Semantic Training Research
# =============================================================================
# Before building Crystal Validation tools, we need to understand HOW to teach
# Timmy meaningful content. Random thoughts won't produce semantic clusters.
#
# Research sprint: 3 AIs (Grok, Gemini, Claude) investigate approaches.
# =============================================================================

current:
  version: "0.10.0"
  status: research
  name: "Semantic Training Research"
  summary: "How to teach Timmy meaningful content for Law Crystal emergence"

  context: |
    Law Crystal hypothesis requires semantic clustering in embedding space.
    Random thoughts → random embeddings → no clusters → no crystals.
    We need structured, value-laden content for emergence to occur.

  tasks:
    - id: "TRAIN-1"
      title: "Research: Curated ethical scenarios"
      status: pending
      agent: "Claude"
      description: |
        Can we hand-craft ethical dilemmas and value statements?
        What format? How many? What diversity is needed?

    - id: "TRAIN-2"
      title: "Research: Text corpus injection"
      status: pending
      agent: "Gemini"
      description: |
        Feed philosophy/ethics texts (Asimov, TMI sources, Cury).
        How to chunk? How to preserve context? Token limits?

    - id: "TRAIN-3"
      title: "Research: Synthetic scenario generation"
      status: pending
      agent: "Grok"
      description: |
        LLM generates value-laden scenarios programmatically.
        Quality control? Diversity metrics? Bias detection?

    - id: "TRAIN-4"
      title: "ADR: Semantic Training Strategy"
      status: pending
      description: |
        Synthesize research into ADR with chosen approach.
        Define training corpus format and injection pipeline.

  success_criteria:
    - "ADR-049 accepted with training strategy"
    - "Training corpus format defined"
    - "Injection pipeline designed"
