# DANEEL TMI Roadmap
#
# WHAT to build - milestones only
#
# Core thesis: Human-like cognitive architecture may produce
# human-like values as emergent properties.
#
# ORIGIN: This idea has been developing since ~2005. See ORIGIN.md

current:
  version: "0.2.0"
  status: in_progress
  summary: "MV-TMI Actors - Foundation Layer"
  goal: "BUILD_FOUNDATION_ACTORS"
  strategy: |
    Facta non verba. Build first, publish with evidence.
    Pedantic: cargo fmt, cargo clippy -D warnings, 100% test pass.

    CONTEXT MANAGEMENT: One file per agent to avoid context explosion.
    Each file is a separate agent task (~200-500 lines output max).

  # GRANULAR AGENT TASKS (one file per agent, max parallelism)
  # Context budget: <200k input, <64k output per agent
