# CURRENT SPRINT: v0.6.0 - 24-Hour Continuity Test
# =============================================================================

current:
  version: "0.6.0"
  status: wip
  name: "24-Hour Continuity Test"
  summary: "Prove the architecture works with sustained runtime"

  # ==========================================================================
  # HIGHLY-CRITICAL: Forge Pulse Analysis
  # ==========================================================================
  # The pulse is "too nice" - clockwork regularity instead of lived arrhythmia.
  # Forge analysis will quantify the transition from clockwork to fractal.

    priority: "HIGHLY-CRITICAL"
    origin: "Rex + Grok + Claude Opus 4.5 - Dec 20, 2025 (12PM insight)"
    description: |
      Connection Drive pulses too regularly - fixed frequency actors, neutral salience.
      As coherence tips, pulse should fractalize: bursts, valleys, arrhythmia.
      Forge can map the transition from clockwork to lived psychology.
