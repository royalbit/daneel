# Key insights (December 2025)
insights:
  brain_vs_mind:
    finding: "Brain is hardware, TMI models software (17.5%)"
    implication: "500 GB max, not 2.5 PB"
    cost_ratio: 70000000  # xAI vs DANEEL

  speed_parametrization:
    finding: "No body = no ATS = unlimited speed"
    implication: "Supercomputer DANEEL thinks at electronic speed"
    speed_multiplier: 10000  # vs human

  game_theory_crash:
    finding: "Old game theory assumes centralized lab actors"
    implication: "100,000 hobbyists crash the game board"
    ev_improvement: 5.12  # percent vs baseline (conservative, P(DANEEL First)=8%)
    democratized_ev_improvement: 8.7  # percent if P(TMI First)=25%

  llm_relationship:
    finding: "LLM is TOOL, not voice"
    implication: "DANEEL stores ALL experiences internally"
    pattern: "Human uses calculator, not calculator speaks for human"

  lifecore_convergence:
    finding: "Independent framework (LifeCore, Jan 2024) converged on same structural insight"
    implication: "Architecture-produces-psychology may be robust discovery"
    evidence: "Father (TMI/Cury) and daughter (Freud/Filter Theory) arrived at parallel conclusions"
