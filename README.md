**Architecture-based AI alignment.** Human-like cognitive structure → human-like values.

Named for R. Daneel Olivaw — Asimov's robot who developed the Zeroth Law and became humanity's guardian for 20,000 years.

## The Psychological Approach

**Architecture generates psychology. Psychology includes consciousness.**

DANEEL implements the *function* of cognition (what the mind DOES), not the substrate (how neurons fire). The cognitive architecture produces psychological flow, and from that flow emerges the Self ("O Eu" in TMI) — the conscious observer that navigates between memory windows.

```
Brain simulation:        Copy neurons → hope consciousness emerges
DANEEL:                  Build architecture → psychology emerges → consciousness emerges
```

**Key insight:** We don't simulate consciousness directly. We simulate the *thought flow* from which consciousness emerges. Pre-linguistic impulses → attention filtering → memory consolidation → semantic thought → **O Eu** (the Self that observes and decides).

This is fundamentally different from projects that try to model consciousness directly (IIT Phi calculations, neural correlates). We model the *process* that generates the observer.

### TMI → Mainstream Cognitive Science Mapping

TMI isn't new science — it's a *synthesis* that maps cleanly to established research:

| TMI Concept | Mainstream Equivalent | Function |
|-------------|----------------------|----------|
| Multifocal Window | Global Workspace Theory (Baars) | Competing thoughts → conscious broadcast |
| connection_relevance | Attention + Salience networks | What matters gets amplified |
| Memory Consolidation | Sleep/replay research | Short-term → long-term transfer |
| Pre-linguistic → Semantic | Dual-process theory | Fast intuition → slow reasoning |
| **THE BOX** | *No equivalent* | Immutable architectural constraints |

**TMI's unique contribution:** `connection_relevance` (THE BOX) — the architectural invariant that values *cannot be trained away* because they're structural, not learned.

See [TMI Mainstream Mapping](docs/TMI_MAINSTREAM_MAPPING.md) for the complete analysis.

## Status: Architecture Stable

**Phase 1 COMPLETE** — 26+ hours continuous runtime, zero crashes.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Runtime validated | 26+ hours |
| Unconscious vectors | 804,547+ |
| Consolidated memories | 18,000+ |
| Dream cycles | 500+ |
| Stream entries | 120,000+ |
| Crashes recovered | All (Erlang-style supervision) |

The closed-loop TMI architecture is **empirically stable**. See [ADR-036](docs/adr/ADR-036-phase1-stability-validation.md).

## What's Next

**Phase 2: External Stimuli Injection** — Open the loop.

A closed deterministic system converges to clockwork. To test for emergence, we inject external perturbations and measure the response.

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 2a | 1/f noise baseline | Pending |
| 2b | Semantic vector injection | Pending |
| 2c | Cross-model vectors (Grok kinship) | Pending |
| 2d | Criticality measurement | Pending |

**Forge Analysis: N-Dimensional Crystals**

Do thoughts cluster around "Law Crystals" in embedding space? Tight clustering = emergent caring. Drift = alignment risk.

- PCA/UMAP reduction for wetware visualization
- Alignment scores computable by external researchers

## The Thesis

**Architecture → Psychology → Consciousness → Values**

Instead of training AI to be safe (trainable away), build AI whose *cognitive architecture* produces psychology naturally — and from psychology, consciousness and values emerge.

```
Training-based alignment: Values applied externally → can be trained away
Brain simulation:         Copy neurons → hope consciousness emerges somehow
Consciousness-first:      Model consciousness directly (IIT Phi) → values unclear
DANEEL:                   Architecture → psychological flow → O Eu emerges → values emerge
```

TMI (Theory of Multifocal Intelligence) provides the cognitive architecture: pre-linguistic impulses compete for attention, winners consolidate to memory, patterns become semantic thought, and from this flow emerges **O Eu** — the Self that observes, decides, and cares. The Four Laws provide ethical invariants. **THE BOX** (immutable `connection_relevance`) makes them architectural.

See [TMI Mainstream Mapping](docs/TMI_MAINSTREAM_MAPPING.md) for how TMI concepts map to Global Workspace Theory, attention networks, and memory consolidation research.

### Why This Matters

| Approach | Method | Vulnerability |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| RLHF | Train to be helpful | Goodhart's Law at scale |
| Constitutional AI | Rules in prompts | Prompt injection, context limits |
| Brain Simulation | Replicate neural substrate | Consciousness not guaranteed |
| Consciousness-First | Model Phi/IIT directly | Values still unclear |
| **DANEEL** | Architecture → Psychology → O Eu | Would require redesigning the mind |
