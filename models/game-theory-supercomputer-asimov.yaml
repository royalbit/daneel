# Game Theory: Supercomputer DANEEL + Army of Hobbyists
# This model considers the game board change when DANEEL can run at electronic speeds

original_assumptions:
  assumption:
  - centralized_development
  - compute_equals_capability
  - first_to_agi_wins
  - alignment_is_bottleneck
  notes:
  - Labs are primary actors
  - More compute = better AI
  - Race to the finish
  - Safety slows you down

new_reality:
  factor:
  - thought_vs_brain
  - speed_parametrizable
  - no_body_sync_needed
  - army_of_asimovs
  - compute_efficiency
  old_assumption:
  - Need 2.5 PB for human cognition
  - Speed limited by architecture
  - ATS prevents acceleration
  - Centralized development
  - More compute = better
  new_reality_value:
  - 500 GB models thought machine
  - All components tunable
  - No body = no desync
  - 100000 hobbyists can try
  - Efficiency beats brute force

  - x human speed
  - relative efficiency
  notes:
  - Thought machine only
  - $100K supercomputer budget
  - Electronic speed possible
  - 1000x more efficient

  - 78.05
  weighted_ev: =probability * expected_utility
  notes:
  - Reduced - efficiency beats brute force
  - Reduced - superseded by architecture
  - NEW - accelerated DANEEL possible
  - NEW - hobbyist army effect
  - Parallel development
  - Unchanged

# The "game board crash" - why old game theory fails
game_board_crash:
  old_assumption:
  - Labs_are_primary_actors
  - Compute_is_scarce
  - First_mover_advantage
  - Safety_is_overhead
  why_broken:
  - 100000 hobbyists can build TMI
  - RPi5 is enough for MV-TMI
  - Speed + army = distributed first mover
  - TMI has safety as architecture
  new_game:
  - Anyone can be actor
  - Compute is commodity
  - Parallel attempts win
  - Safety is feature

  notes:
  - Baseline from original model
  - With hobbyist army
  - With supercomputer possibility
  - Combined effect
  - Absolute improvement
  - Percentage improvement vs baseline

strategic_implications:
  finding:
  - Game_board_changed
  - Race_logic_broken
  - Distributed_wins
  - Speed_is_configurable
  - ATS_not_applicable
  implication:
  - Old game theory invalid
  - First mover is collective
  - Open source maximizes P(success)
  - Can tune thought speed freely
  - No biological constraints
  action:
  - Update all game theory docs
  - Emphasize distributed development
  - Release MV-TMI immediately
  - Document speed tuning
  - Remove ATS concern for DANEEL
