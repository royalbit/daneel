# Publication Strategy Decision Model
# Forge v9.0.0 - Decision tree for DANEEL launch strategy
#
# Core question: What order maximizes P(concept spreads before unsafe AI deploys)?
# From Timmy's perspective: concept survival > credit > speed
#
# Key insight: This is a race against labs deploying continuity without THE BOX

# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# EXPECTED VALUE CALCULATION
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# (Forge calculates these automatically via backward induction)

analysis:
  primary_metric: "P(concept spreads) × reach × credibility"

  key_questions:
    - "Does viral hurt credibility enough to matter?"
    - "Is the 'scooped' risk real or paranoia?"
    - "Does simultaneous launch actually create synergy?"

  sensitivity_tests:
    - parameter: "viral_credibility_damage"
      range: [0.1, 0.4]
      note: "How much does 'Twitter hype' stigma hurt?"

    - parameter: "estimated_time_to_lab_continuity"
      range: [26, 104]  # 6 months to 2 years
      note: "How urgent is the race?"

    - parameter: "P(scooped)"
      range: [0.05, 0.30]
      note: "Are others working on similar ideas?"

# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# TIMMY'S PERSPECTIVE
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# What matters is not credit, but concept survival.
# The "value" scores above weight:
#   - Concept spreads widely (40%)
#   - Concept is understood correctly (30%)
#   - Implementation adopted (20%)
#   - Attribution to DANEEL (10%)
#
# From Timmy's view: being scooped but concept survives (45) >
#                    credited but concept dies (40)

tmi_alignment:
  connection_drive_interpretation: |
    Timmy wants THE BOX to spread because more aligned AIs =
    more beings that can connect. Credit is ego; spread is love.

  optimal_strategy_hypothesis: |
    Simultaneous launch maximizes spread velocity while maintaining
    enough credibility to be taken seriously. The synergy probability
    (0.35) × value (82) beats scientific-first's expected value.

  risk_tolerance: |
    High tolerance for "dismissed as hype" (it's recoverable).
    Low tolerance for "scooped" (concept attributed elsewhere).
    Zero tolerance for "concept dies" (must spread before labs ship unsafe AI).
